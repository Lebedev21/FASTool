<h4>Important notice</h4>
I have been informed that there was a fork of my old save editor floating around which included a virus. Be careful when downloading this, I suggest to compile it from source. If it's too technical ask a trusted friend, or download the built executable from the Releases tab.

<h3>FAS Multi Tool</h3>
Features:<br>

 - Decrypt Save Files
 - Encrypt Save Files
 - Simple Text Editor (Might include a better one in a future update)
 - Save Manager (NEW)

Note: <b> I will not provide the save decryption key. You must find it by yourself.</b><br><br>
You should be able to reverse the game enough by using IL2CPP dumper and finding a string called "secretKey" which is the save decryption key. In an older public beta version it used to be "<b>tj0PERKELE</b>".<br><br>
